Hi guys, this is my experimental / toy project of a full stack web application, I will also deploy this. 
I got my inspiration from the internet, I was just reviewing for a NodeJS job interview and accidentaly, started this. 
My initial plan was to make a web app using Java Spring Boot, but I ended up doing this project made of Node.JS, HTML, CSS, Express, and Socket.io.
I added my own implementation of the tutorial to check and experiment on what ever I may think of.

I am facing problems regarding instagram integration, I am having a hard time figuring out how to display my IG picture in my new page.

I had a hard time integrating my IG profile, I moved on to adding daily covid update via Covid API and fetch. Added some mobile responsiveness on my landing page.

Added new feature, this web app can now save data using nedb, thanks to coding train's tutorial about database, still a work in progress, I just started the form and the api route to save database. Next is on this project is to add ajax to save the data via api route.

Saving visitor's form feature added, will work on the UI improvement using bootstrap and page to show all the visitors who dropped me some messages via this app

I found out that saved data in this app is getting deleted after some time, but its working. Pushed changes to improve the landing page and mobile responsive too.

Got busy with Java this past few months. I am planning to update this page and deploy to heroku. :)
