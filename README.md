Hi guys, this is my experimental / toy project of a full stack web application, I will also deploy this. 
I got my inspiration from the internet, I was just reviewing for a NodeJS job and accidentaly started this. 
My initial plan was to make a web app using Java Spring Boot, but I ended up doing this project made of Node.JS, HTML, CSS, Express, and Socket.io.
I added my own implementation in the tutorial to check and experiment on what ever I may think of.

I had a hard time integrating my IG profile, I moved on to adding daily covid update via Covid API and fetch. Added some mobile responsiveness on my landing page.
